				<p>	My name is Shane Cruz, and I am a Photographer and Graphic Designer. I was born in upper Manhattan and grew up in the Bronx. I began taking photos and graphic designing in high school but did not take it seriously until my sophomore year in college at John Jay. After I realized studying criminal justice wasn't for me, I transferred to BMCC to pursue a degree in graphic design. I am now currently still in BMCC but will graduate by the end of 2018. I am now living again in Manhattan. My goal is to show the beauty and emotions of people and places and do freelance design work. I focus on creating abstract photos and designs, as well as traditional ones.  The name of my business is "SMC Designs". I specialize in commercial and freelance photography, as well as designing logos and editing photos. I am skilled in Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign. I believe my work should be a reflection of me as well as the subject at hand. I believe all art should accessible and displayed no matter the message, or what is pictured. I am based in New York, but I am available to travel around the globe for projects. I do some freelance wedding photography, but I also shoot with Anthony Vazquez studios.
