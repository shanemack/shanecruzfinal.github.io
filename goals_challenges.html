				<p>As a freelance photographer, I am always working on writing new content that can be applied to different industries, and featured in different forms of display. A publishing company may come across my website to explore my photography portfolio, and learn more about me as a photographer. An art exhibit owner looking for artists to feature in one of their shows may stumble across this site. 
</p>

				<p>My website is primarily to market myself as a photographer, but also to build a relationship with others and allow them to connect with my images on a deeper level. Young adults may have interest in exploring my website because they want to see some of my photos that  relate to topics they find relevant or interesting. For my final project I would like to link all my social media to the page, and also provide a way people could purchase prints straight from the website. I would also like to add more written content as well as more images. Also maybe add a carousel of my images, and design a logo for the website to put as the header. I’d  like to do what ever extra credit assignments are available, and continue to complete homework assignments, and edit any I didn’t get a high grade on. </p>
